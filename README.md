# Church Website

This is a design for a church website that could also be used for a number of different business websites. The focus is on loading speed and progressive enhancement--from mobile to desktop.

I've tried to incorporate the idea of layered pages--which just means that information is layered below what the user can see and pops up at the time the user wants the information. This is in contrast to the page-based model that requires users to navigate to a page full of information that he must then scroll through. 

Instead, the user can get the information delivered right to him in a bite-sized snippet that is relevant when the impulse to click strikes him. This sort of just-in-time information is very app-like and quickly digestible by the user. This means less scrolling and, hopefully, a more efficient use of the user's time.
